# ValenciaClub-WebApp : As Valencia Tech Organization was in need to a web application for the management of its operations and meetings ,I developed this app during my 6 months internship in the Valencia College Orlando.
-Registration and authetication in several roles (Admin ,Technician , Simple user)
-This app still needs some features , but already the users could make an appointment precising the tools they need to be fixed .
-After registration of their tools users will receive a recipient in pdf form with the  time of meeting and tools to bring
-The users of this app will be able to follow up with the procedures of fixing their computers to know when the technician have a requirement , or whether he finished fixing the tool or still didn't begin yet .
-many other options are available for the users , download the code and open it in VS 2013 for more infos 

For Technicians :
-Via this app technicians could find out what tools wil be in the labo for the next week , and every technician could choose what tools and problems he could fix 
-Technicians when reserving a tool , they could put when it will be finished , how much time it need to be fixed , and filling in the timeline so the customer could follow up with them
-Technicians could contact the customer via email anytime to ask him for a requirement or tell him about the situation of his tools
-much more options are available for the technicians to explore

For administrators:
-Administrators have access to statistics , contacting the technicians and customers , changing time of meetings and fixing the periods of time their staff will be available for taking new tools to fix
-Also they could follow up with the activity of each technician (how many tools he fixed , how many hous he worked ..)
-administrators could follow up with each client , his donation and his tools to be fixed and the priority of his operations
